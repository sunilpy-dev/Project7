# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I Have created the password manager website using the react.js
I have used the localstrorage in this project for the database management and make this more interactive
I have also added the features of passowrd hiding,copy of liks and username etc. and save 
Also i have added the edit and delete option sso that one can change it and if want can delete it. 
Here are some pictures of that website
